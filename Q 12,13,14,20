# 12. Why Inferential Statistics? Explain the difference between Correlation and Causation with an example.

Correlation
- Indicates a statistical relationship between two or more variables.
- It means that variables tend to change together.
- It can be positive, negative or non existent.
Causation
- One variable causes a change in other variable.
Example     --> eating ice cream directly causes sunburn.
Correlation --> There is a correlation because both ice cream sales and sunburn cases tend to increase during the summer months.
Causation   --> More people go to the beach during the summer which leads to more sunburns.More people buy ice cream during the summer to cool down.


# 13. Population vs. Sample: Why do we need sampling? Provide a real-world example.

- Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals, items, or data from a larger group to make inferences about the entire population.
- Sampling reflects the characteristics of the population.
- Several reasons are feasible, cost effective, time efficient, more accurate and reliable.
Example :
A large Indian mobile phone manufacturer is launching a new smartphone model and wants to understand the potential customer interest, preferred features, and the price point consumers are willing to pay.
The population of interest here is all potential smartphone buyers in India. This is a very large and diverse group, encompassing people of various age groups, income levels, and technological preferences across urban and rural areas.


#14. Hypothesis Testing Concepts: Define Null Hypothesis, Alternate Hypothesis, Significance Level (α), and P-value.

- Null hypothesis (H₀) - is our initial assumption about a population, often stating there's no effect or no change. We try to find evidence to disprove it.
- Alternate hypothesis - is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents the claim or the effect that we are trying to find evidence for.
- Significance level (α) - is the risk we accept of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis (saying there's an effect when there isn't). It's our decision-making threshold.
- P-value - is the probability of seeing our results (or more extreme ones) if the null hypothesis is true. It tells us how likely our data is just by chance.


#20. Summarize the key takeaways from the analysis performed above and describe how descriptive and inferential statistics can be used in real-world data analysis.

Descriptive statistics - summarize and describe main features of dataset. It includes calculating average, creating charts and graphs, and measuring datas.
                         eg - Painting a picture of data.
Inferential statistics - Draws conclusions or make inferences using available data. It makes predictiona, test hypothesis, determine relationships within data.
                         eg - Small piece of puzzle to understand whole picture.
